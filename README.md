# CopyOfWebServer
A copy of a ~30 hour Project from a Graduate Course. In this assignment, I built a web Sever Framework. The idea was to copy the functionality of Common Frameworks like Spark or Django.

A user could use this code to build their own static web server. 

This shows that I have an understanding of HTTP protocols, the ability to write detail oriented back-end code, and organize a large maven build.
